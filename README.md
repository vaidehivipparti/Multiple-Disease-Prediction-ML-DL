# Multiple Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a final-year B.Tech project that focuses on predicting multiple diseases using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques.  
The system allows users to predict the possibility of certain diseases based on medical inputs and images.

The project is designed with separate modules for each disease to ensure accurate and independent predictions.
